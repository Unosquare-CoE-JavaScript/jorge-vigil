# React testing with Jest

Not just a library, also a philosophy

- Test software the way users actually use it, not internal implementation
- Find elements y accessibility markers not IDs

# React testing lib vs Jest

## React testing library

- Provides virtual DOM for tests

## Jest

- Provides a test runner that
    - Finds tests
    - Runs tests
    - Determines whether tests pass or fails

# First test

```jsx
$ npm test
```

When running this command inside an app generated with create-react-app, it will run jest in watch mode
