# EsLint

- Popular linter for JS
    - **Linter**: analyzes static text and marks syntax that breaks rules
    - **Static**: analyze code as written, not what happens when code is run
- Linting keeps code style consistent
- Also catches errors in code
    - Using variables before defining
    - Import from nonexisting file
    - etc

# Linting vs formating

- Formatters (like prettier) automatically format (indents, spacing)
- Linters address format and style

# ESLint plugins

- ESLint extensions
- Testing library and jest-dom ESLint plugins
    - Enforce best practices
